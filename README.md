# code-quiz
This is my code Quiz you have 20 seconds to answer 5 questions.
If you get an answer wrong then you lose 3 seconds on your time.
Your score goes up the faster you complete the quiz.
It saves your high score so you can try and beat your time.
I used some simple html and styled it with css.
most of the page itself is java code.
When you click the start button the quiz begins and the timer starts counting down.
when you finish you will be asked to add your initals and save your score.
you can also delete your high score and start over.
